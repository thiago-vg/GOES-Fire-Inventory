This repository contains the scripts associated with the article:

**"Particulate and gas emissions from wildfires in the southern Amazon, from 2020 to 2022, from GOES-16 fire radiative power retrievals."**

## Overview
These scripts are designed to analyze particulate and gas emissions from wildfires in the southern Amazon using fire radiative power (FRP) data from the GOES-16 satellite. The computations rely on the Pangeo open science community's Docker image, ensuring a reproducible and scalable workflow.

### Example Output
Below is an example image generated by one of the scripts:

## Prerequisites
To run these scripts, you need to use the **Pangeo-notebook** Docker image:

[![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-Hub-blue?logo=docker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/pangeo/pangeo-notebook)  
[![Pangeo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pangeo-Open%20Science-green?logo=python)](https://www.pangeo.io/)

Ensure you have **Docker** installed on your system before proceeding.

Some of the generated maps require the use of shapefiles, all of which are included in the "Auxiliary data" directory.

- The shapefile for the **Amazon Basin** is sourced from: [![Amazon Basin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon_Basin-Map-blue)](https://cartographyvectors.com/map/1255-amazon-basin)
- The shapefiles for **roads and cities** come from the **Natural Earth** database: [![Natural Earth](https://img.shields.io/badge/Natural_Earth-Data-green)](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Pull the Pangeo Docker Image**:
   ```sh
   docker pull pangeo/pangeo-notebook:latest
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/work --rm pangeo/pangeo-notebook
   ```
   This will start a Jupyter Notebook server that can be accessed at `http://localhost:8888/`.

3. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   cd YOUR_REPO
   ```

4. **Open JupyterLab and Start Working**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/`
   - Open the scripts within the `work` directory in JupyterLab.

## Scripts and Usage
The provided versions of the algorithms are designed to run on the JupyterLab workspace and use an edited version of the CSV file extracted from the FEER inventory database, located in the "Auxiliary data" directory in this repository as “FEERv1.0_Ce_user”. The original file from the FEER database can be obtained from the database website: [FEER Database](https://feer.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/emissions/).

Scripts prefixed with "Get" are utilized to retrieve and process data from GOES-16 and save the results in a CSV file. Additionally, there are scripts dedicated to plotting data extracted from the CSV files.

Scripts prefixed with "Get" are recommended to be run locally, especially if the user intends to process larger geographical areas or longer time periods to acquire the processed data. Ensure that you configure the directories to store the CSV files generated by the "Get" scripts and specify the directories from which the other scripts will read the CSV files.

The corresponding codes for each task and the resulting images in the article are represented in the figure below, which streamlines the process and facilitates understanding and implementation.
