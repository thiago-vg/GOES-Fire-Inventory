# Particulate and Gas Emissions from Wildfires in the Southern Amazon (2020-2022)

This repository contains the scripts associated with the article:

**"Particulate and gas emissions from wildfires in the southern Amazon, from 2020 to 2022, from GOES-16 fire radiative power retrievals."**

## Overview
These scripts are designed to analyze particulate and gas emissions from wildfires in the southern Amazon using fire radiative power (FRP) data from the GOES-16 satellite. The computations rely on the Pangeo open science community's Docker image, ensuring a reproducible and scalable workflow.

### Example Output
Below is an example image generated by one of the scripts:

## Prerequisites
To run these scripts, you need to use the **Pangeo-notebook** Docker image:

- Docker Hub: [pangeo-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/pangeo/pangeo-notebook)
- Pangeo Open Science Community: [Pangeo.io](https://www.pangeo.io/)

Ensure you have **Docker** installed on your system before proceeding.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Pull the Pangeo Docker Image**:
   ```sh
   docker pull pangeo/pangeo-notebook:latest
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/work --rm pangeo/pangeo-notebook
   ```
   This will start a Jupyter Notebook server that can be accessed at `http://localhost:8888/`.

3. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   cd YOUR_REPO
   ```

4. **Open JupyterLab and Start Working**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/`
   - Open the scripts within the `work` directory in JupyterLab.

## Scripts and Usage
The repository contains the following scripts:

- `data_preprocessing.py` - Prepares and processes GOES-16 FRP data.
- `emissions_calculation.py` - Computes particulate and gas emissions based on FRP retrievals.
- `visualization.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook for visualizing spatial and temporal emissions patterns.

### Running the Scripts
Execute Python scripts within the Pangeo JupyterLab environment:
```sh
python data_preprocessing.py
python emissions_calculation.py
```
Alternatively, open and run `visualization.ipynb` interactively.
